# master_codebreaker_webapp

This is an implementation of the classic codebreaking game. The player must guess the colors (in order) of four hidden pegs generated by the computer. For each color that the player guesses correctly, a black peg is placed next to that row on the board. If the player guesses the correct color in the wrong location, a white peg is placed. The player has 12 turns to guess all four colors in their correct locations.

This app is built in Ruby with Sinatra.
